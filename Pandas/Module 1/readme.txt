These are my practice notes which I have compiled from below sources:
1. Kaggle Microcourse on Pandas
2. Codebasics Videos on Youtube Channel
3. justmarkham data sets
4. Anjali Pal's Python in 15 days challenge
5. Pandas documentation

It is advisable to go through these notes for any begginer and practice on the same lines. These notes are comprehensive and no need to learn the syntax and codes- Google is there for help!!
Enjoy Learning!!
